This is really a good book. Scott Kelly takes us for a one year trip across the world, within small spaceship, the International Space Station.

I started to digest the book in whole chapters, but then, I realised, that spending each evening on the Space Station, gave me a whole new opportunity and perspective. Thatâ€™s why I decided to read a section a day.
